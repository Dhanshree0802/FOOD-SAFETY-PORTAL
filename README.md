# Food Safety Portal (FSP) - Software Engineering Lab Case Study

### üìã Project Overview
The **Food Safety Portal (FSP)** system is a centralized platform designed to meet the needs of city residents, visitors, and employees by providing access to food-related information within the city. The system facilitates informed dining choices through restaurant search, online booking, and feedback submission features. Additionally, the FSP system helps city employees manage customer records efficiently, enabling personalized service delivery. Restaurant guides use the platform to streamline booking processes, manage daily activities, and generate performance reports.

Admins play a pivotal role in overseeing user management, permissions, and complaint resolution, ensuring the integrity and functionality of the platform. The FSP model's key attributes include:
- User accounts
- Review forms
- Comments/complaints
- Ratings
- Restaurant search functionality
- Viewable restaurant listings
- Account modification capabilities
- Website updating functionalities

These features contribute to an ecosystem that promotes food safety, accessibility, and transparency within the city, benefiting both residents and visitors alike.

### üõ†Ô∏è UML Diagrams Developed

During the software engineering lab, the following UML diagrams were developed to provide a comprehensive view of the system's architecture, behavior, and interactions:

- **Class Diagrams**: Represent the static structure of the system, showcasing classes, attributes, methods, and their relationships.
  
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Illustrate the interactions between system actors and use cases, depicting how users interact with the system to achieve specific goals.
  
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Capture the interactions and message exchanges between objects or components over time, illustrating the dynamic behavior of the system.
  
- **Activity Diagrams**: Model the flow of control and behavior within a system, showing the sequence of activities and decision points.
  
- **State Machine Diagrams**: Represent the states, transitions, and behaviors of objects or components within the system, depicting their lifecycle and state transitions.
  
- **Component Diagrams**: Depict the physical components of the system and their dependencies, showing how components are interconnected and deployed.
  
- **Deployment Diagrams**: Illustrate the deployment architecture of the system, showing the physical nodes, hardware devices, software components, and their relationships.
  
- **Package Diagrams**: Organize and structure the elements of the system into logical groupings or packages, showing the dependencies and relationships between packages.
